            Lush green valleys of Switzerland. Violins in the background. 
            A woman in a saree runs across the frame. A man opens his arms — and millions fall in love.
            <br><br> 
            Romance, in all its forms — the classic climax chase, the love triangle, the tragic ending — dominated Bollywood in the 1990s and well into the 2000s.
            These decades gave us some of the most iconic films. Films that still draw crowds on Valentine’s Day. 
            Films that became history. Their albums played on loop and dialogues quoted endlessly.
 
        <br><br>
        
            But, after being smitten in love for years, it seems like Bollywood has moved on.

        <p>
            In seven of the ten years, the highest grossing film of the year belonged to the romantic genre.
            <br><br>
            The decade was marked by some of the most iconic romantic Bollywood films, including <i>Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge (DDLJ), 
            Devdas, Dil Toh Pagal Hai, Raja Hindustani, Mohabbatein</i> and <i>Veer-Zaara</i>. 
            DDLJ, released in 1995, remains the longest-running film ever, having played continuously since its release. 
            In 2025, it will mark 30 years in theatres. 
            <br><br>
            A genre analysis of blockbuster and hit films from the last three decades shows how romance, once the ruler of the box office, slowly faded away.
            <br><br>
            Films have multiple genres, but for this analysis, each film has been classified based on its dominant narrative tone. 
            All romantic sub-genres — including rom-coms, romance-action, romance-drama, and romantic-thrillers — have been grouped under a single “romance” category. 
            Similarly, films labelled as action, action-comedy, or action-thriller have been grouped as “action.” Horror, sci-fi, masala and thriller films have been clubbed together as “others.”

            While the decade did see some memorable romantic hits — <i>Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani, 
            Bodyguard</i>, and <i>Jab Tak Hai Jaan</i> among them — it was largely defined by Bollywood’s three Khans: 
            Salman Khan, Aamir Khan, and Shah Rukh Khan.
            <br><br>
            Action became the dominant flavour, with films like <i>Dabangg, Ghajini, Ek Tha Tiger</i>, and the <i>Dhoom</i> 
            series ruling the box office. By the second half of the decade, the shift was prominent, and Bollywood 
            had found a new love. 
            <br><br>
            It was now chasing spy thrillers, action-packed cop dramas, and big-budget heist films.

            By this decade, the violins had quietened. But the silence was replaced by the noise of films 
            high on jingoism, hyper-nationalism and historical themes.
            <br><br>
            This year’s blockbuster, <i>Chhaava</i>, a biopic of Sambhaji Maharaj, the second ruler of the Maratha 
            empire, took a leaf out of the same book. Films in recent years have glorified Hindu rulers and 
            portrayed Muslim rulers as evil aggressors.
            <br><br>
            Alongside historical epics, there has been a rise in politically loaded films such as <i>The Kerala Story</i>, 
            a film that claimed to tell the “true” story of 32,000 girls who had fled the South-Indian state Kerala 
            to join Islamic State (the figure has been debunked by a fact-checking website Alt-News).
            <br><br>
            <i>The Kashmir Files</i>, which depicts the exodus of Kashmiri Hindus from the Kashmir valley in the 1990s, 
            has been criticised for its portrayal of Kashmiri Muslims. <i>Article 370</i> is another example that tried 
            to promote the ideological stance of the ruling government in India on Kashmir.
            <br><br>
            <strong style="color: #F54ABC; font-size: 22px;">A boy's club</strong> 
            <br><br>
            The 250 films analysed were made by 131 different directors. The industry, long dominated by men, began to 
            see women delivering superhits in the 2010s — but only a few. 
            <br><br>
            Over the three decades analysed, just five female directors have delivered 10 blockbusters or hits. 
            These include Farah Khan (3), Zoya Akhtar (2), Meghna Gulzar (2), 
            Gauri Shinde (2), and Reema Kagti (1). 
            <br><br>
            As many as 126 male directors have given 240 hit films, the most by David Dhawan (14), followed by Rohit Shetty (8) and Anees Bazmee (7).

            Similarly, films led by women have been few and far between. With the exception of Bandit Queen (1996), most were seen only in the 2010s. 
            <br><br>
            Of the 250 films analysed, just 14 featured a female lead at the centre of the story.
